# Data Modeling with Cassandra 

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create an ETL pipeline that:

- Reads and processes event data files.

- Extracts relevant fields.

- Loads the processed data into a Cassandra database for efficient querying.

- Create queries using CQL.

The ETL pipeline and queries are developed using Python and leverages Cassandra for data storage.

This project is part of the Data Engineering with AWS course by Udacity (Course 2, Lesson 4). It involves creating an ETL pipeline to process, store data and create queries using Apache Cassandra.
